# 🍯 Honeypots: Turning Attacks into Learning Opportunities

## What is a Honeypot?

A **honeypot** is a security mechanism designed to appear as an attractive target to attackers while serving as a trap to detect, deflect, and study hacking attempts. It functions as a decoy system strategically placed within a network to:

- 🔍 Monitor attacker behavior and techniques
- 🛠️ Identify the tools and methods used in attacks
- 🔐 Analyze infiltration patterns and pathways
- 🎯 Understand attackers' objectives and motivations

## 🌟 Benefits of Using Honeypots

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Early Detection** | Identify suspicious activity before it affects production systems |
| **Threat Intelligence** | Gather valuable data about new attack vectors and techniques |
| **Attacker Distraction** | Keep hackers occupied with decoys while keeping real systems safer |
| **Security Improvement** | Use insights to enhance overall security posture |

## 📋 AWS EC2 Honeypot Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up the EC2 Instance
1. Sign into your AWS account
2. Search for **EC2** services
3. Change the region to your preferred location (e.g., **Northern California**)
4. Click on **"Launch Instance"**

### Step 2: Selecting the AMI
1. Browse available AMIs in the AWS Marketplace
2. Search for **Debian 11** (after experiencing issues with Debian 12)
3. Review and accept pricing details (~$0.11/hour)
4. Subscribe to the selected AMI
5. Choose instance type **t2.xlarge** for optimal performance

### Step 3: Storage Configuration
1. Allocate **128GB of storage** to the instance
2. Launch the instance
3. Wait for the instance to reach the **"running"** state

### Step 4: Security Setup
1. Create a **key pair** (RSA format)
2. Download the key file automatically to your browser
3. Assign an **Elastic IP (EIP)** to your instance for stable addressing

### Step 5: Terminal Connection
1. Open **Kali Linux terminal**
2. Set proper permissions for your key file:
   ```bash
   chmod 400 your-key.pem

### Step 5: Terminal Connection
1. SSH into the instance:
   ```bash
   ssh -i your-key.pem admin@<your-elastic-ip>

Step 6: Port Configuration

Configure a custom port (e.g., 64295) for secure access
Reconnect using the specified port:
```
bashssh -i your-key.pem -p 64295 admin@<your-elastic-ip>
```

Step 7: Web Access Setup

Navigate to your instance in the AWS Console
Locate the IPv4 address of your honeypot
Access the web interface via browser:
```
https://<IPv4-address>:64295
```

Acknowledge security warnings (it's your server)
Input web server credentials created during setup
